Data flow:
    From https://127.0.0.1:2999/liveclientdata/allgamedata/
        playerInfo = data["allPlayers"][playerID]
        skinID = playerInfo[skinID] %>% str()
        championName = playerInfo[championName]
    From https://raw.communitydragon.org/latest/plugins/rcp-be-lol-game-data/global/default/v1/champion-summary.json
        Find the object in this array whose ["name"] == championName.
        championID = ["id"]
        championAlias = ["alias"]

    From https://raw.communitydragon.org/latest/plugins/rcp-be-lol-game-data/global/default/v1/champion-chroma-images/{championID}
        If skinID == 0:

        Try GET splash art as usual, using skinID.
        If it 404's then it's a chroma.
            Try GET f"{/championID}_{int(skinID): ___}.png"
            If it 404's then it's something mysterious.
                Log it!




Goals:
    Seraphine_3 should have a nice spread of colors.
    Senna_0 should not select red.
    Ashe_0 should be all blues, no pink
    Vex_0 should get more of the extreme greens somehow
    Leona_11 shouldn't include skin tones



Ideas:
    To select k, perform clustering with a large k, say k=12.
    For each k, weight them proportionally by the # of points in that cluster and to the saturation of that cluster center


    Wait what if we choose k so that we get colors that aren't too far
    For example, Nurse Akali (Akali 4). With k=6, LeagHue picks up 5 shades of icy blue, and 1 shade of purple
    I reckon this distribution, if you were to "un-modularize" the Hue scale, has a high skew
    So maybe you can try a few k's and pick the one with the least skew



Tickets:
* Colors should be modular around 360 going into the model
* Try blurring the image going in, to remove detail lines.
* Build a better coloring model (maybe k-means isn't so great information entropy-wise)
* Deprioritize skin tones and prioritize gold tones somehow idk maybe that's just a symptom of a model that doesn't include location
* Monitor system processes for `LeagueClient.exe` so that LeagHue can check less frequently when you're not playing vidya.
