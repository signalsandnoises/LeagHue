Data flow:
    From https://127.0.0.1:2999/liveclientdata/allgamedata/
        playerInfo = data["allPlayers"][playerID]
        skinID = playerInfo[skinID] %>% str()
        championName = playerInfo[championName]

        Find the object in this array whose ["name"] == championName.
        championID = ["id"]
        championAlias = ["alias"]

    From https://raw.communitydragon.org/latest/plugins/rcp-be-lol-game-data/global/default/v1/champion-chroma-images/{championID}
        If skinID == 0:

        Try GET splash art as usual, using skinID.
        If it 404's then it's a chroma.
            Try GET f"{/championID}_{int(skinID): ___}.png"
            If it 404's then it's something mysterious.
                Log it!




Goals:
    Seraphine_3 should have a nice spread of colors.
    Senna_0 should not select red.

Ideas:
    To select k, perform clustering with a large k, say k=12.
    For each k, weight them proportionally by the # of points in that cluster and to the saturation of that cluster center

Tickets:
* Implement a logger
* Build a better coloring model
* Reduce model time.
* Monitor system processes for `LeagueClient.exe` so that LeagHue can check less frequently when you're not playing vidya.
