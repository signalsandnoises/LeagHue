''' This app will be structured so that it queries the League API every second when inactive.
When it gets a successful query, we start querying every 0.1 seconds.

Events:
	death: (de-saturate, then reset upon respawn)
	ace: (rainbow)
	victory: turn blue, then reset after 10s
	defeat: turn red, then reset after 10s


On initialization, we create a LightManager which manages the lighting environment.

In the main-loop, we query to detect whether the game has started, once per second. Once it has,
we construct GameState.

The GameState is initialized with a champion and their skin. It tracks all in-game events.
